# Communications

This repo contains all public communications, from WIP to completed status.

## Blog

A copy of all posts from our [ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) [blog](https://blog.joystream.org/) are kept here. Unpublished posts are typically additional step-by-step instructions accessible through in-post links or on demand, that are either temporary workarounds and/or not actually necessary for most users.

`URL` refers to blog.joystream.org/`url`
