# Communications

This repo contains all public communications, from WIP to completed status.

## Blog

This folder contains all content stored in our [ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) blog.

`Published` posts are featured posts from [blog](https://blog.joystream.org/).  
`Permanent` refers to permanent content in separate subpages.  
`Unpublished` posts refers to supplementary content only accessible via links inside other posts.  
`Drafts` are posts that are not yet reviewed, or for other reasons awaiting publication.

All `published` posts are named so that blog.joystream.org/`post-name` will direct you to the correct posts.

## Newsletter

WIP: have something here on branding guide and assets, perhaps list of posts also, wiht status (draft, in review, posted, etc.)
