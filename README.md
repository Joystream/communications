# Communications

This repo contains all public communications, from WIP to completed status.


## Contribute

As an open source project, we are always looking for contributors. You can read more about the process [here](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream#contribute), and the potential rewards [here](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk#builders-and-bug-reporters).


## Blog

A copy of all posts from our [ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) [blog](https://blog.joystream.org/) are kept here. Unpublished posts are typically additional step-by-step instructions accessible through in-post links or on demand, that are either temporary workarounds and/or not actually necessary for most users.

`URL` refers to blog.joystream.org/`url`
