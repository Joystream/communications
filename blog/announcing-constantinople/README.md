#### Lead

Since the succesful launch of the Rome testnet in late March, we have begun work on our next release, codenamed Constantinople.

#### Body

## What is Constantinople?

The Rome network will revolve around one key platform feature - a dynamic, flexible and user friendly content directory. Our reasoning for focusing on this task, that may seem narrow and trivial at first glance, is the long term value of it:

-   The platform will allow for new *types* of content and data, with as little friction as possible.
-   Adding metadata to existing content, improving the user experience through better search, etc.

You can read more details about Rome in our [release plan](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/master/testnets/rome).

## Shorter Release

As for previous testnets, we will continue to [pay community members for participating](https://blog.joystream.org/pay-for-play/). In addition to the existing roles, `Validator`, `Council Member` and `Storage Provider`, we will add one new *paid* role, the `Content Curator`.

In short, the `Content Curator` will be responsible for monitoring the content directory. A more detailed description of their responsibilities, requirements and rewards will be covered in a future blog post.

In addition to that, platform `members` will be able to create `Content Creator` profiles associated with their membership. This will allow users to create multiple "channels" under the same membership handle.

If you want general information about current and future roles on the Joystream network, go [here](https://www.joystream.org/roles) to read more, and sign up for the newsletter of the roles you find appealing.
