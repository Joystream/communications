#### Lead

After the launch Athens on mid April, we have fully shifted our attention to our next testnet - Acropolis.

#### Body

What is Acropolis
-----------------

As the name might suggest, our intention is for Acropolis to build on, and improve on some of the issues we encountered with the [launch of Athens](https://blog.joystream.org/athens-released/). Perhaps the most interesting change for most users, is the introduction of the first "half" of the platforms integrated communication system - the on-chain forum.

#### On-Chain Forum

This is the first step in providing users, active and interested occupants of platform [roles](https://www.joystream.org/roles), council members and  future stakeholders a way to communicate, coordinate, interact and hopefully develop a strong community.

#### Specifications

Both in the short, medium and long term, we need a way to onboard developers in an efficient way. The longevity of the project relies on a sufficient set of contributors that can write new features, and test and verify the code.

#### Storage and Distribution

We have identified some problems with the [current product](https://github.com/Joystream/storage-node-joystream), and have decided to attempt to improve and simplify the system. As a sidenote, the [new product](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/pull/45) released with Acropolis will be shipped with tranches, allowing `Storage Providers` not to have to hold the entire Content Directory as it grows.

Release Plan and OKRs
---------------------

In line with the project goal of openness, transparency and attempting to build a self sustained platform without [Jsgenesis](https://blog.joystream.org/jsgenesis/)' involvement, we are releasing public [Release Plans](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/master/testnets/acropolis) for each testnet. More on this in an upcoming blog post. Perhaps the most tangible output of the Release Plan process, is the the Release [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR):

#### Objective: Launch Acropolis Network

1.  `Get 75 posts on forum (limits, not Jsg)`
2.  `Forum (runtime), storage (runtime and P2P) fully specd`
3.  `Have 4x replication for all 2 tranches on storage node`
4.  `95% uptime Storage Provider`
5.  `No PRs merged to master (excluding bugfixes and "pioneer") after "Sub-system Test"`

Contribute and Earn Monero
--------------------------

Although Joystream is currently controlled by us at Jsgenesis, our goal has always been, and still is, to withdraw and leave it in the hands of our community to own, operate and govern. In order for that transition to work smoothly, we need contributors at **all levels**. Just participating on our testnets is helping us immensely (hence why we [pay monero](https://blog.joystream.org/pay-for-play/) for doing so), but we need help in other ways as well.

Both detailed specing and opening our project management and planning process on github at an early stage are steps we hope will attract both technical and managerial talent.

Developers can report issues or make PRs to [our repos](https://github.com/Joystream), following our [standard rules](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream#contribute). In addition to the [small bounties](https://github.com/JoyStream/helpdesk#builders-and-bug-reporters) we promise for small "patches", feel free to contact us anywhere if you have something larger in mind.
