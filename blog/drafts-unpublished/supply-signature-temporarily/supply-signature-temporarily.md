Supply Signature Temporarily
============================

As some of you may have noticed, you can currently not set your memo with an empty balance or when staking. Here is how to cryptographically prove your XMR address in another way:

-   Go to `Settings` in the sidebar and change `interface operation mode` from "basic" to "fully featured" --> `save & reload`.
-   Go to `Toolbox` in sidebar, then choose `Sign message`.
-   Using the Joystream address you want to tie, paste your monero address like so:

-   This will prompt you for your password. Type it in, and hit `Sign`
