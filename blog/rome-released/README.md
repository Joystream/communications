#### Lead

After launching the new chain for our latest testnet, Rome is live with a new content directory, new roles and a new incentive scheme!

#### Body

Chain Reset
==

As stated in [here](https://blog.joystream.org/from-acropolis-to-rome/), Rome is launched on a new chain. Memberships and the forum have been migrated, but apart from that, it's a fresh start. This means all `Validators` and `Storage Providers` that wants to continue in their roles must change their setup. Guides to get started can be found [here](https://github.com/Joystream/helpdesk).

New Roles
--

Rome offers one completely new role as `Content Curators`, and adds incentives for `Content Creators`.

Get Paid to Participate
==

As for previous testnets, Rome has it's own incentive scheme. Unlike previous testnets however, we are introducing a dynamic system where slots and rewards will be subject to a weekly review. For the next testnet, this will be controlled by the council, but for Rome, it will be decided by Jsgenesis. Learn more about the incentives [here](https://blog.joystream.org/rome-incentives/). The specifics of this are also available in our [helpdesk repo](https://github.com/JoyStream/helpdesk).

The following roles qualify for rewards`*`:

1.  `Validators` will split $100 per week based on blocks found.
2.  `Council Members` will receive $10 to get elected, + bonus if called to vote.
3.  `Storage Providers` will split $120 per week based on uptime, + a larger bonus for content stored.
4.  `Content Creators` will complete for $250 per week to upload content.
5.  `Content Curators` will each share $180 per week plus performance bonuses.
6.  `Builders and Bug Reporters` can collect bounties for finding or fixing bugs.

`*`Note that the stated rewards applies to the first week only

Get Started

If you just want to have a look at the new testnet, go [here](http://testnet.joystream.org/). If you need any help getting started, we ask you to consult our [helpdesk repo](https://github.com/JoyStream/helpdesk) first. If you have further questions, post them as `Issues` there, or ask in our [Telegram](https://t.me/JoyStreamOfficial)!

With a lot of changes since our last testnet, this applies just as much to old and new participants.
