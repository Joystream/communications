#### Lead
The latest runtime upgrade proposal on Constantinople has passed, providing new opportunities for testnet participants.


#### Body

Moving To Nicaea
----------------

Internally, we've been using the codename *[Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaea#Byzantine_period)* to refer to this upgrade to Constantinople, reflecting its somewhat limited scope in comparison to most of our previous releases.

Nonetheless, we have aimed to further promote the autonomy of the platform (particularly the Council) in this release and we hope this will yield some interesting results!

Changes To Hiring Process
-------------------------

Perhaps the most noticeable change for *Nicaea* is the introduction of a new role, the `Storage Provider Lead`. This platform actor is hired by the council through an on-chain application process which relies on the proposals system.

Once hired, this actor is responsible for hiring, firing, and managing Storage Providers, a job which was previously the responsibility of the development team (through `sudo`) and was more recently delegated to the council.

New Command-Line Interface
--------------------------

Another of the important "upgrades" to Constantinople included in the sub-release is the introduction of a new command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Joystream network.

You can of course manage all of your keys etc. within the new application but we have also decided to support more advanced functionality. Notably, the CLI is by far the easiest method for the new `Storage Provider Lead` to coordinate the hiring, firing and management of storage providers.

Get Started
-----------

All `Storage Providers` operating on Constantinople have been kicked on account of the new hiring process led by the council-appointed lead.
