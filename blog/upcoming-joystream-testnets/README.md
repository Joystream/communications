#### Lead

As we get closer to releasing our new Rome testnet, we wanted to share with our loyal supporters some of our plans and ideas for the next few releases and beyond.

#### Body

## Introduction

We are often asked about features that we hope to implement in future testnets and we encourage discussions about this topic in our Telegram Group, on-chain forum and GitHub repositories. This blog post will aim to address some of the uncertainty surrounding our ambitions for future testnet releases over the next few months and years.

## Rome

Since our [last blog post](http://151.236.222.69/announcing-rome) on Rome, we have made some important changes to the way our next testnet is likely to work.

We have also made some important decisions about which types of content Pioneer (our testnet application) will support upon launch. While previously we had said that we would introduce support for eBooks, podcasts and videos, we have now scaled down our goals and will be supporting two content types on launch: videos and music albums.

You can follow our progress on Rome in our [GitHub repos](https://github.com/joystream).

## Constantinople
We have big ambitions for our post-Rome testnet.

Among the features and changes you might see in Constantinople:
- Getting rid of the memo module
- [Major improvements to the on-chain forum](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/150)
- More focus on developing measures to prevent Sybil attacks
- Introduction of communication features for members
- An advanced proposal system which facilitates discussion
- Encouraging further [sideprojects](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22side+project%22) for new developers

<i>Note: All of these features are in the discussion and planning stage, and we can't promise that they'll be included.</i>

## Future Releases
We can promise with even less certainty what users might be able to expect from the testnets which follow Rome and Constantinople. We learn a great deal from each release, and the lessons from every release are factored into our planning for the next. Nonetheless, we have had discussions about the more distant future for Joystream and some of the results of these discussions are listed below.

Broadly speaking, you can expect our goals to follow those set out in our OKRs (available to view [here](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/tree/master/okrs)).
Some of the ideas that have been suggested for implementation in these further ahead releases include:

- JoystreamSDK - An integrated SDK for writing applications on top of Joystream.
- A Joystream command-line interface
- A proof-of-concept advertising system
- Developing "tranches" for storage providers and bandwidth providers

## Summary
Ultimately, Joystream aims to become the platform described in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/Joystream/whitepaper/blob/master/paper.pdf). 

We will need community involvement to make our ambitious vision of Joystream become a reality and we are grateful for all of the support we have received so far.
