Short excerpt:

Acropolis is live!

#### Body

## Runtime Upgrade to Acropolis

As described in [this post](https://blog.joystream.org/upgrades/), the Substrate SDK allows us to upgrade the consensus rules without a hardfork. That means we can do in-flight upgrades like these, without the need for `Validators` or other full nodes to do anything to stay in consensus.

## Get Paid to Participate


In a previous [post](https://blog.joystream.org/pay-for-play/), we explained the philosophy of why we are paying users to contribute on our testnet.

In our last [post](https://blog.joystream.org/acropolis-incentives/), we outlined the incentive structure for Acropolis. The specifics of this is also available in our new [helpdesk repo](https://github.com/JoyStream/helpdesk).

The following roles qualify for rewards:

1.  `Validators` will split $50 based per week on blocks found.
2.  `Council Members` will receive $10 to get elected, + bonus if called to vote.
3.  `Storage Providers` will split $300 per week based on uptime, + bonus for content stored.
4.  `Builders and Bug Reporters` can collect bounties for finding or fixing bugs.

## Get Started

If you just want to have a look at the new testnet, go [here](http://testnet.joystream.org/). If you need any help getting started, we ask you to consult our [helpdesk repo](https://github.com/JoyStream/helpdesk) first. If you have further questions, post them as `Issues` there, or ask in our [telegram](https://t.me/JoyStreamOfficial) and [rocket.chat](https://chat.joystream.org/home)!

With a lot of changes since our last testnet, this applies just as much to old and new participants.

## On-Chain Forum


This is the first step in providing users, platform [role](https://www.joystream.org/roles) participants, council members and future stakeholders a way to communicate and coordinate. Hopefully, this method of interaction will further help develop a strong community around Joystream. Note that you have to be a `Member` to post, and only the forum moderator (forum sudo) can create categories.

#### Storage Providers

Note that all current `Storage Providers` will get booted once the new network is live. This is because new software is required.
